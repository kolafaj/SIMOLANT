# Executables

ZIP-files contain the executable and the manual `simolant.html` which can be browsed from running simolant (menu Help).  File `simolant.html` and dll's must be placed in the same directory as the executable.

* To download, click the link first, then click symbol â¤“ (download raw file).
* To install, unzip the selected zip to a directory (folder).
* Do not run the executable directly from the ZIP because it is extracted to a temporary folder.

## Linux

* 64 bit: `simolant-linux.zip`<br />
  You may need to install missing libraries using your package system.

## Windows

* 64 bit, partly static linking: `simolant-win.zip`<br />
  The missing libraries are included. 
* <font color=gray>OLD 32 bit, static linking (no dll's needed): `simolant-win32.zip`</font>

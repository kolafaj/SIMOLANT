  <p>Molecules attract each other when they are close together (the
    "atom disks" almost touch).  If the molecules are even closer, they
    begin to repel (the disks overlap).  If the atoms are far away,
    they (almost) do not feel each other.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When SIMOLANT starts, the temperature is set high and you see
      molecules moving freely in a box.  This is a (two-dimensional)
      gas.</li>
    <li>Cool the system (using slider <font face="helvetica">T</font>)
      to a temperature about T=0.6
      (watch <font color=red face="helvetica">T=</font> in the right top panel).
      The molecules will slow down, the attraction forces prevail and
      cause the molecules to condense to a liquid droplet.</li>
    <li>Hence, cool the system to about <font face="helvetica">T=0.3</font>.
      Molecules will arrange spontaneously to a hexagonal lattice.</li>

  <a name="Model"></a>
  <h2><font color="NAVY" face="SANS">Molecular models</font></h2>

  <p>A <i>molecular model</i> aka <i>interaction potential</i> aka <i>force
    field</i> is the energy of a pair of atoms <i>r</i> apart expressed as a
    function, <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>).  The total energy is the sum of these pair
    terms over all pairs of atoms.  We do not use any real units – the units
    are defined by the respective formulas and the Boltzmann
    constant <i>k</i>=1.  The potential type and its parameters are printed
    at the top of the right panel next to the number of particles; e.g.,
    "N=300 LJ c=4"</p>

  <a name="Potential"></a>
  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i>Lennard-Jones-like interaction potential</i></font></h3>

  <p>The default interaction potential is a 2D analogue of the Lennard-Jones
    potential:</p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = 4/<i>r</i>⁸ − 4/<i>r</i>⁴
  </p>
  <p>Term 4/<i>r</i>⁸ is positive and therefore repulsive.  The term
    −4/<i>r</i>⁴ is negative and therefore attractive; it has a longer range
    than the repulsive term.  The minimum of the potential is −1
    at <i>r=</i>2^(1/4)=1.189 (line marked as rmin in the graph of RDF).</p>

  <p>The potential is truncated at <i>c</i> (can be set in window cmd:)
    and smoothed:</p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = 4/<i>r</i>⁸ − 4/<i>r</i>⁴  &nbsp;  for <i>r</i> &gt; <i>c</i>₁,<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = <i>A</i>(<i>r</i>² − <i>c</i>²)² &nbsp;  for <i>r</i> ∈ (<i>c</i>₁,<i>c</i>),<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  for <i>r</i> &gt; <i>c</i>,
  </p>

  <p>where constants <i>A</i> and <i>c</i>₁ (<i>c</i>₁&lt;<i>c</i>) are
    determined so that both the potential and forces are continuous (the
    derivate of forces has jumps).  No cutoff corrections are added.  The
    recommended default <i>c</i>=4, the minimum is <i>c</i>=2.232.</p>

  <p>The critical point for the default c=4 version is approximately T=0.85,
    P=0.06, ρ=0.3 for <i>c</i>=4.  The Boyle temperature is 3.0138.
  </p>

  <a name="WALLS"></a>
  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i>Walls and gravity</i></font></h3>

  <p>The walls can keep the particles in a box or a slit.  There are two types
    of walls, attractive and repulsive.  The attractive wall is built of the
    same particles as the 2D Lennard-Jones (without truncation), but imagine
    them ground to tiny pieces and smoothly distributed on one side of the
    wall with number density ρ=N/L²=0.75 (can be changed by option
    -Pwall=VALUE or from cmd:).  The particle–wall potential is thus</p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i><sub>wall</sub>(<i>d</i>) = πρ (5/24 <i>d</i>⁶ −1/<i>d</i>²)
  </p>

  <p>The repulsive wall is similar, only the attractive (negative) term is
    omitted.  The walls are active in the respective boundary conditions, the
    sign can be changed in panel Walls.</p>

  <p>If horizontal walls are present, gravity can be turn on.  The potential
  per particle is</p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i><sub>gravity</sub>(<i>y</i>) = <i>−gy</i>
  </p>
  Negative <i>g</i> is the usual gravity.  <br>
  <b>Bug or feature:</b> the virial of the force of gravity is not included in the pressure tensor calculation.

  <a name="Limits"></a>
  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i>How realistic is this?</i></font></h3>

  <p> The two-dimensional model used by SIMOLANT is easier to show and
    simulate than a realistic three-dimensional model of, e.g., water.
    Nevertheless, basic concepts shown are <i>qualitatively</i> the same as in
    three dimensions.  The only notable exception is a possibly different
    nature (universality class) of the freezing transition.  If water freezes,
    a nucleus of ice appears and then it grows – there is an interface between
    both phases.  This is the first-order phase transition, other example is
    vapor condensation in both 2D and 3D.  However, when some 2D systems are
    cooled, there is no interface between ordered (frozen) and disordered
    (liquid) phases (Kosterlitz–Thouless continuum transition).  Instead,
    hexagonally ordered areas grow anywhere in the system.  At the freezing
    point the size of these areas diverges to infinity, i.e., in equilibrium
    we obtain a single crystal structure spanning the whole system.  Other 2D
    systems freeze as in 3D (i.e., via the first order phase transition), but
    the nucleation phenomena are not so apparent; this is likely the case of
    2D hard disks.  The type of freezing of our 2D system is not known.</p>

  <p> The model is more appropriate for 2D systems as surfactants
    floating on a surface of water.  Such molecules form 2D gas, 2D
    liquid, and hexagonally ordered 2D solids (and even more...).
    The surface pressure can be easily demonstrated in a kitchen by
    throwing a few matches to a bowl of water and touching the surface
    by a piece of soap.</p>

  <p> The potential decreases to zero more slowly than London forces in
    3D; therefore, gas at moderate densities is less ideal than in 3D –
    the compressibility factor Z deviates from 1, especially at low
    temperatures. </p>

  <a name="Potentials"></a>
  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i>More interaction potentials</i></font></h3>

  <p> In addition to the standard Lennard-Jones-like potential, several more
    or less weird potentials are supported:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a name="WCA"></a><b>WCA interaction potential</b><br>
      The WCA potential is the Lennard-Jones (here 2D version) potential
      truncated at the minimum and shifted:<br><br>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = 4/<i>r</i>⁸ − 4/<i>r</i>⁴ +1 &nbsp; for <i>r</i> &lt; <i>c</i><br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; for <i>r</i> &ge; <i>c</i><br><br>

      where <i>c</i> = 2^(1/4).</li>

    <li><a name="PD"></a><b>Penetrable disks and ideal gas</b><br>
      Penetrable spheres, here penetrable disks, is a simple model of
      a polymer coil in a good solvent.<br><br>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = a(r²−c²)²/c² &nbsp; &nbsp; for <i>r</i> &lt; <i>c</i><br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for <i>r</i> &ge; <i>c</i><br><br>

      The default is <i>a</i>=1, <i>c</i>=2.  From cmd:, any value can be set:<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>a</i>&gt;0 &nbsp; &nbsp; repulsive penetrable spheres (disks),<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>a</i>=0    &nbsp; &nbsp; ideal gas (not too much fun with it),<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>a</i>&lt;0 &nbsp; &nbsp; attractive penetrable spheres (disks) are
        thermodynamically singular (the thermodynamic limit diverges).</li>

    <li>
      <a name="DW"></a><b>Double wall</b><br> The double wall potential with a
      good choice of parameters might give a quasicrystal of 2D Penrose
      tessellation:<br><br>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = const (1−<i>r</i>²) (<i>a</i>²−<i>r</i>²) (<i>b</i>²−<i>r</i>²) (<i>c</i>²/<i>r</i>²−1)² &nbsp;  for <i>r</i> &lt; <i>c</i><br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>) = 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for <i>r</i> &ge; <i>c</i><br><br>

      where, for the sake of temperature scale purpose, const is calculated so
      that ∫_1^∞ <i>u</i>(<i>r</i>)² d<i>r</i> = 512/1155 is the same as for
      the 2D Lennard-Jones.  Parameters <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the nodes
      (zero values of the potential), it should hold 1 &lt; <i>a</i>
      &lt; <i>b</i> &lt; <i>c</i>.  No check is performed of this condition.
      The default <i>a</i>=1.25, <i>b</i>=1.4, <i>c</i>=2 set from the Force
      Field menu is likely close to the Penrose structure, use cmd: to
      change.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="Linklist"></a>
  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i>Pair sum and linked-cell list</i></font></h3>

  <p>Calculating the interaction potential and forces needs to consider all
    neighbors of a particle within the cutoff distance <i>c</i>. Three algorithms
    are available.
    <ol>
      <li> If the cutoff is longer than half box size,
        <font face="helvetica">c&gt;L/2</font>, one particle may interact with
        different periodic replicas of other particles.  Thus, the sum over
        all pairs of particles is amended by the triple sum over all replicas
        of the central cell that may contain interacting particles.
        For <font face="helvetica">c&gt;L</font>, a particle even interacts
        with its own periodic replicas.  However,
        condition <font face="helvetica">c&gt;L/2</font> is not typical for
        most examples with many particles, so that this algorithm is rarely
        activated.</li>
      <li> If the cutoff is a little bit shorter than half box size or for a
        few particles only, the pair sum is calculated as a simple double
        sum.</li>
      <li> If the cutoff is shorter than half box size, which typically
        happens for many particles, the pair sum is calculated by the
        linked-cell list method.  It is based on domain decomposition of the
        box into <font face="helvetica">ncell×ncell</font> cells.  For each
        particle in each cell, only the cells within the cutoff (and “ahead” to
        avoid counting each pair twice) are considered and scanned for
        possible interactions.  Only calculations of forces in molecular
        dynamics and the box swelling/shrinking in NPT MC are treated by this
        algorithm.  The sums needed in Metropolis MC displacements and
        calculating RDF and other quantities at the end of a cycle are
        evaluated by algorithms 1 or 2.</li>
    </ol>
    The algorithm choice is controlled by
    variable <font face="helvetica">ncell</font> available from input field
    cmd:
    <ul>
      <li><font face="helvetica">ncell=0</font> (default) means that the
        appropriate method is selected automatically.</li>
      <li><font face="helvetica">ncell=1</font> selects the direct pair method
        2 (unless <font face="helvetica">c&gt;L/2</font> for which method 1 is
        used).</li>
      <li><font face="helvetica">ncell&gt;1</font> chooses the linked-list cell
        method 3 with the selected number of cells per box side (unless <font face="helvetica">c&gt;L/2</font> for which
        method 1 is used).</li>
    </ul>
    Since the default <font face="helvetica">ncell=0</font> may not be
    optimum, you are encouraged to
    try <font face="helvetica">ncell&gt;1</font> by hand.  The top right panel
    shows the timing sampled every 2 s.

  The simulation start, methods, and parameters of simulation, and
  quantities to observe are prepared for you to observe phenomena.

  <ul>
    <li><b><u>G</u>as</b><br>
      A dilute system at temperature <font face="helvetica">T=1</font>
      represents a (two dimendional) gas.
      Try to cool it to about <font face="helvetica">T=0.6</font> and
      observe the changes.</li>

    <li><b>+ <u>D</u>iffusion</b><br>
      As above, and molecules are colored so that you can observe
      diffusion.

    <li><b>+ G<u>r</u>avity</b><br> Gas in a gravitational field.  Watch the
      vertical density profile (use sliders simulation speed and Measurement
      block for better precision).</li>

    <li><b>Vapor-liquid <u>e</u>quilibrium</b> <br>
      A "vessel" periodic in the <i>x</i>-direction is prepared with liquid at
      bottom, <i>T</i>=0.65.</li>.  Watch pressure and density as you cool or
      heat the system a bit.  See also <tt>clausius-clapeyron.pdf</tt>
      workout</li>

    <li><b>Horizontal <u>s</u>lab</b> <br>
      A "vessel" periodic in the <i>x</i>-direction is prepared with
      a liquid slab at center, <i>T</i>=0.6.</li>

    <li><b><u>N</u>ucleation</b><br> Dilute gas is prepared and quickly cooled
      (quenched).  Several small droplets soon form.  They coalesce to bigger
      droplets.  For a more realistic simulation corresponding better to the
      condensation of water vapor in wet air, the Langevin thermostat is used
      – heat transfer between air and droplets is modeled by random forces.
      If you are patient, you may observe another phenomenen responsible for
      growth of large droplets at the expense of small ones – Ostwald
      ripening.  The trick is that small droplets evaporate faster than the
      big ones because of their curved surface.  On the contrary, bigger
      droplets catch more eagerly flying molecules and grow faster.</li>

    <li><b><u>L</u>iquid droplet</b><br> A small droplet is produced at
      temperature <font face="helvetica">T=0.6</font> in the periodic
      boundary consitions.  It will solidify on cooling and evaporate on
      heating up.<br>
      With a smaller number of particles, lower density and small τ, the
      flying icecube artifact can be observed with the Berendesen
      thermostat.</li>

    <li><b><u>T</u>wo droplets</b><br> Two droplets are prepared at
      temperature <font face="helvetica">T=0.6</font> in the periodic boundary
      conditions.  They approach each other with velocity <i>v</i>=1 (can be
      changed from cmd:) The simulation is switched to NVE.  Based on the
      value of <i>v</i>, heating or cooling is observed on the graph of
      Tkin.</li>

    <li><b><u>B</u>ubble (cavity)</b><br>
      A cavity (commonly called "bubble") in liquid.</li>

    <li><b><u>C</u>apillary</b><br>
      Capillary action under a microscope. The left, right, and bottom
      walls are attractive and a small gravity is turned on. You can see

      A perfect piece of hexagonal crystal
      at <font face="helvetica">T=0.2</font> is prepared.
      The number of particles may change to match a regular hexagon.
      Molecules are colored according to the number of neighbors.
      The colors are chosen from the Okabe and Ito colorblind-safe palette.
      <br>
      <b>Hints:</b>
      <ul>
        <li> <b>Melt</b> the crystal (increase T).</li>
        <li> <b>Impact</b> it to the ground (use gravity) – it will
          recrystallize because of low T.</li>
        <li> <b>Smash</b> it to the ground at constant energy (switch to
          the NVE molecular dynamics and then use gravity).  A crystal will
          melt and perhaps evaporate; set dt=0.02 (using cmd: input field)
          in case of problems with too large forces.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b>+ <u>E</u>dge defect</b><br>
      A piece of crystal with an edge dislocation.  The defect quickly
      travels through the crystal and eventually disappears at the
      crystal surface.  Use slide simulation speed if this is too fast.

    <li><b>+ <u>V</u>acancy</b><br>
      One missing atom in a perfect crystal. This defect slowly diffuses.</li>

    <li><b>+ <u>I</u>nterstitial</b><br>
      One additional atom in a perfect crystal. This atom has a high
      energy diffuses very fast.</li>

    <li><b>Pe<u>r</u>iodic crystal</b><br> An approximate periodic crystal at
      temperature T=0.3 and the periodic boundary conditions is prepared in
      the NPT ensemble.<br>

      It is not possible to exactly match a hexagonal lattice to a square
      boundary conditions; however, the following "magic numbers" of particles
      lead to less and less distorted crystals:<br><br>
      &nbsp;  &nbsp; N = (0, 1,) 4, 15, 56, 209, 780, 2911, 10864, 40545, ...<br>
      &nbsp;  &nbsp; Recursively: N<sub>n</sub> = 4N<sub>n−1</sub>−N<sub>n−2</sub> (N<sub>0</sub> = 0, N<sub>1</sub> = 1)<br>
      &nbsp;  &nbsp; Explicitly: N<sub>n</sub>  = [(2+√3)^n−(2−√3)^n] / (2√3)<br><br>
      The maximum error in the angle (π/3 = 60°) of both basis vectors  is 1/2N = 28.65°/N.<br>

      The code first rounds the number of particles to the nearest (in the
      logarithmic sense) magic number and then it constructs the crystal.
      The minimum is 15, the maximum (with N= from cmd:) is 2911.
      Other "less magic" solutions (as doubled magic numbers with the crystal
      rotated by 45°) are not considered.<br>

      For N=15 or 56, low T and appropriate ρ or P, the best crystal forms
      spontaneously.  For higher N this happens only occasionally and (e.g.)
      several heating/freezing cycles are needed to obtain a crystal without
      defects.<br>
      Hint: prepare a crystal, type button [N+] to include an interstitial and
      [N−] to remove one atom. You will observe a vacancy and interstitial
      annihilating.

  <p>Here the simulation method (MC/MD), ensemble (NVE, NVT, NPT) and
    thermostat/barostat flavors are selected.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b><u>A</u>utomatic (MC→MD/Bussi CSVR)</b><br>
      Several first steps are performed by the Metropolis Monte Carlo method
      at constant temperature T (this is marked by symbol MC→MD in the right
      top corner).  After particle overlaps are removed, the simulation
      switches to molecular dynamics (symbol [MD/Bussi CSVR], see
      <a href="#Bussi">Bussi CSVR thermostat</a>).  If a problem is
      encountered (particle overlap which would lead to integration failure),
      several Metropolis Monte Carlo steps are automatically performed
      again.</li>

    <a name="Creutz"></a>
    <li><b>Monte Carlo NVE (<u>C</u>reutz)</b><br>
      The Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm samples the configurations of
      molecules using random moves.  In the constant-energy Creutz
      version, a demon with a bag full of energy visits molecules and
      tries to push them randomly a bit (random displacement in a disk
      of diameter d).  If the energy decreases, the move is accepted
      and the demon stores the released energy in the bag.  If the
      energy increases, the move is performed only if there is enough
      energy in the demon's bag, otherwise the move is rejected and
      the simulation continues with the original unchanged
      configuration.  This procedure is repeated many times (one MC
      sweep is when every particle is tried to move once).
      <br>
      If there is (on average) a lot of energy in the bag, the
      configurations of the system have high energy, too, which means
      that the temperature is high.  Mathematically, the demon's
      energy is distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution,
      prob(Ebag) = const exp(-Ebag/<i>k</i>T), hence the temperature
      is given by averaged bag energy as

      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Tbag = ⟨Ebag⟩/<i>k</i>.
      </p>

      In the right panel you will see this temperature averaged in blocks of
      one or more sweeps.  It fluctuates in the course of the simulation.<br>
      By default, the trial displacement is determined automatically to reach
      the acceptance ratio of 0.3.  For productive runs, this should be turned
      off by button [▯&nbsp;set&nbsp;MC&nbsp;move].
    </li>

    <a name="Metropolis"></a>
    <li><b>Monte Carlo NVT (<u>M</u>etropolis)</b><br>
      The more useful Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm works at
      constant temperature T, which is a parameter of the
      simulation.  Here the demon visits a termostat before every step
      and gets energy corresponding to its temperature.
      Mathematically

      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Ebag = −<i>k</i>T ln(rnd),
      </p>

      where rnd is a random number drawn uniformly from interval (0,1).
      Once again, high-energy configurations are more probable at high
      temperatures, low-energy configurations at low temperatures.  The
      demon's temperature Tbag converges to the thermostat temperature
      T and then fluctuates around it (on average, the energy the demon
      returns to the thermostat equals the energy he gets back).</li>

    <a name="MCNPT"></a>
    <li><b>Monte Carlo N<u>P</u>T (Metropolis)</b><br>
      The volume of the system randomly fluctuates in the isothermal-isobaric
      (NPT) ensemble.  Again, the change of volume is either accepted or
      rejected to maintain constant pressure on average.  Note that the
      simulation box is always drawn at the same size and the sizes of
      molecules change instead.<br>
      For experts: We use the volume measure μ=1/<i>V</i>, to be compatible
      with MTK, see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0193281">J. Janek and
      J. Kolafa: <i>J. Chem. Phys.</i> 160, 184111 (2024)</a>.<br>
      If the barostat pressure is too low, the volume becomes too large.  In
      this case, an error is reported and the simulation switches to NVT.  You
      should change (increase) P from the cmd: input field.  Alternatively,
      stop simulation by the [▯&nbsp;run] button, then switch to NPT, then use
      the P-slider, then restart simulation by the [▯&nbsp;run] button.<br>
      The trial volume change is not available via a slider; use cmd: dV=VALUE
      or automatic setup by button [▯&nbsp;set&nbsp;MC&nbsp;move].
    <li><b>Molecular Dynamics (NV<u>E</u>)</b><br>
      Molecular dynamics (MD) calculates trajectories of molecules in time
      by numerical integration of the Newtonian equations of motion.
      Molecules thus move "as in the real world".
      <br>
      Mathematically, we use the leap-frog algorithm given by formulas:

      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; v(t+dt/2) := v(t−dt/2) + dt*f(t)/h,<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; r(t+dt) := r(t) + dt*v(t+dt/2),
      </p>

      where v(t) is the velocity (velocities of all particles)
      and r(t) position(s) at time t, respectively, and dt is the
      timestep.  Forces f(t) are calculated from positions r(t).
      <br>
      The total (potential + kinetic) energy is conserved (subject to small
      method errors).  Temperature is calculated from the kinetic
      temperature by formula:

      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Tkin = 2 Ekin / <i>k</i> Nf,
      </p>

      where the leap-frog kinetic energy is
      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Ekin = ∑ m [v(t−dt/2)²+v(t+dt/2)²]/4,
      </p>
      the sum is over all particles, both the Boltzmann
      constant <i>k</i> and particle mass m are here equal 1, and Nf
      is the number of degrees of freedom (Nf=2N in a box; because of
      momentum conservation in the NVE MD, Berendsen and Nosé-Hoover
      thermostats, Nf=2N−2 in the periodic boundary conditions and
      Nf=2N−1 in the slit).
      <br>
      The timestep dt is determined from temperature and thermostat type
      and then kept constant.  In NVE and when temperature changes
      abruptly, the integrator may fail.  A fixed timestep can be set on
      start by option -Pdt=VALUE, or from running simolant from field cmd:,
      variable dt.  The automatic timestep is set by dt=0.
      <br>
      Before the MD simulation starts, new velocities are drawn from the
      Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.
      This applies to all MD methods.
    </li>

    <a name="Berendsen"></a>
    <li><b>Molecular Dynamics NVT (<u>B</u>erendsen)</b><br>

      In order to maintain constant temperature, a thermostat has to be used.
      The simplest one is the Berendsen (friction) thermostat.  It works by
      rescaling all velocities by a factor so that Tkin approaches slowly the
      defined temperature T.  This thermostat (with long enough τ)
      does not affect transport phenomena as diffusivity and
      is good for fast cooling or heating.  The coupling of the thermostat
      with the system is given by the coupling (correlation) time τ.  Too low
      values may cause problems for some systems as, e.g., the infamous
      "flying ice cube" (create a crystal in periodic boundary conditions, use
      τ=0.1 and wait...).  It does not give the true canonical ensemble (the
      same distribution of energies as if the system were at contact with a
      thermostat) which is a disadvantage in some application.</li>

    <a name="NH"></a>
    <li><b>Molecular Dynamics NVT (<u>N</u>osé-Hoover)</b><br>

      This thermostat is based on a dynamic variable (something like a "piston
      of entropy") interacting with the system.  The coupling (correlation)
      time τ must be carefully set (less than 0.3 ps is recommended): Too long
      values lead to long oscillations in temperature and poor convergence
      (the "piston" has large "inertia mass"); too short values require short
      timesteps (the integration may fail).  If everything is set properly,
      this thermostat is probably the best.

      <br>
      The method can be implemented in the Verlet-like methods by several
      algorithms.  Here we use the TRVP (Time-Reversible Velocity Predictor)
      with <i>k</i>=1,
      see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/ct200108g">J. Kolafa and
      M. Lísal: <i>J. Chem. Theory Comput.</i> 7, 3596 (2011)</a>.</li>

    <a name="Andersen"></a>
    <li><b>Molecular Dynamics NVT (An<u>d</u>ersen)</b><br>

      Constant temperature is maintained by thermalizing the molecules
      randomly: A molecule forgets its old velocity and is launched at
      random direction with random velocity corresponding (on average) to
      temperature T (so-called Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution).
      Again, τ determines how often (on average) a molecule is visited by a
      random Maxwell-Boltzmann kicker.  This type of thermostat can be
      interpreted as an action of random impacts of invisible gas molecules
      in which our molecules are immersed.  The algorithm is subject to
      errors for short τ and long dt.</li>

    <a name="Maxwell-Boltzmann"></a>
    <li><b>Molecular Dynamics NVT (Ma<u>x</u>well-Boltzmann)</b><br>

      As above except that all molecules are asigned Maxwell-Boltzmann
      random velocity corresponding (on average) to temperature T at
      once every τ.</li>

    <a name="Langevin"></a>
    <li><b>Molecular Dynamics NVT (<u>L</u>angevin)</b><br>

      Small random forces ceaselessly disturb all molecules.  Since this
      would heat the system, a friction is added to slow the molecules.  If
      both forces are balanced, the system maintains given
      temperature T.  A simple version of the algorithm is
      implemented so that the ensemble is not exactly canonical for short τ
      and long dt.</li>

    <a name="Bussi"></a>
    <li><b>Molecular Dynamics NVT (B<u>u</u>ssi CSVR)</b><br>

      Also called <i>Canonical Sampling through Velocity Rescaling</i>.
      Similar to the Berendsen thermostat except that the rescaling factor is
      amended by a random noise so that the resulting ensemble is canonical,
      see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2008.01.006">Bussi G. and
      Parrinello M., <i>Comp. Phys. Comm.</i> 179, 26 (2008)</a>.</li>

    <a name="MDNPT"></a>

    <li><b>Molecular Dynamics NPT (<u>B</u>erendsen)</b><br>

      Similar as the Berendsen thermostat.  Pressure is maintained by box
      rescaling if the instantaneous virial pressure differs from
      parameter <i>P</i>.  The analogous volume coupling (correlation) time
      τ is calculated from the temperature time constant τ and the bulk
      modulus calculated from a very approximate equation of state,
      cf. variable qtau available via command in window cmd:.

      Hint: use Show → Volume convergence profile with Measurement block
      slided left.

    <a name="MTK"></a>
    <li><b>Molecular Dynamics NPT (Ma<u>r</u>tyna et al.)</b><br>

      Similar to the Nosé-Hoover thermostat but with a box-size-related degree
      of freedom added.  You may interpret it as a "piston", but attached to
      all particles so that it works also in the periodic boundary conditions.
      The time constant of this piston is qtau×τ, τ<0.3 and the default
      qtau=5 are recommended.  The true isothermal-isobaric ensemble is
      generated; however, it may be difficult to adjust the parameters; e.g.,
      for high-temperature gas or crystal.  Also, it may easily crash if the
      initial configuration is far from equilibrium.  Can be used with
      non-periodic boundary conditions, but the scaling is still uniform in
      all coordinates.  Try to view the volume convergence profile and switch
      all three available barostats.<br>

      The method is based on
      paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.467468">G. J. Martyna,

      <a name="V"></a><b>Vicsek with NVT (Langevin)</b><br>

      The same as the Langevin thermostat with the velocity of each particle
      (“bird” or “fish”) attaining the weighted averaged velocity from all
      particles within cutoff <i>c</i>:<br><br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> := ∑<i><sub>j</sub></i> <i>v<sub>j</sub></i>*<i>w<sub>j</sub></i> / ∑<i><sub>j</sub></i> <i>w<sub>j</sub></i>, where <i>w<sub>j</sub></i>=c²−<i>r<sub>j</sub></i>²
      <br><br>
      Then, the velocity is renormalized to |v|=√T.
      A Langevin thermostat step follows. <br>

      Only the periodic boundary conditions are supported (box and slit are changed to periodic).<br>

      A user may change the potential and its parameters; particularly, the
      cutoff <i>c</i> (the same value for the potential and neighbor
      definition); it, however, must not be too long.  Thermostat
      parameter <i>τ</i> controls the chaos.  The temperature with penetrable
      disks and small <i>a</i> essentially scales time and does not change

      <font color=blue>Pvir</font>
      = pressure (calculated from the virial of force);
      this pressure is also used in barostats.
      This pressure for thermostats conserving the linear momenta in the
      periodic and slit boundary conditions include the “kinettic pressure
      correction”.  Thus, the ideal gas in the limit of ρ→0 gives exact
      compresibility factor, Z=1. See the MACSIMUS manual for details and
      tests.  The respective kinetic energy scaling factors are printed as
      qx,qy.<br>

      <font color=blue>Pxx, Pyy</font>
      = diagonal components of the pressure tensor as calculated
      from the virial of force.  This is the natural pressure in the

      values should match. (NB: the virial component of gravity is not
      included.)<br>

      <font color=blue>P(top wall), P(bottom wall)</font>
      = pressure on walls as calculated from forces on walls.<br>

      <font color=blue>γ = gamma</font> = line tension ("surface tension" in 2D):<br>

      &nbsp; &nbsp; MSDx(t) = ∑<sub>i</sub> [x<sub>i</sub>(0)−x<sub>i</sub>(t)]² / N<br>
      and is applied for the last configuration in a block.
      The algorithm operates with scaled coordinates (thus, NPT is valid) and
      follows particle paths in the periodic boundary conditions.  If the
      displacement from the previous position is greater than 0.45 L, error
      message is issued and the MSD calculation is turned off.  The remedy is
      to decrease the block size and/or stride.<br>

      The slope of the linear part of MSD.x(t) and MSD.y(t) is 2D in the
      periodic boundary conditions, where D is the diffusivity.  This
      calculation is rather imprecise (error ~1/√N); therefore, several
      shorter independent measurements should be averaged.  (Ideally,
      overlapping blocks are recommended, see

      The total momentum (or velocity because <i>m</i>=1) of the simulation
      box per particle.

    <li><b><u>I</u>ntegral of motion convergence profile</b><br>
      The conserved energy in MD (NVE: total energy, Nosé-Hoover and MTK:
      extended energy).

    <li><b><u>R</u>adial distribution function (RDF)</b><br>

      The RDF represents the probability of finding a pair of molecules a
      given distance <font face="helvetica">r</font> apart, normalized so
      that for interactionless particles (ideal gas) it is 1.  On
      the <font face="helvetica">r</font>-axis,
      <font face="helvetica">rmin</font> denotes the potential minimum.
      The RDF curve is scaled from zero to the maximum.  To look better,
      the curve is smoothed by applying two (for block=1) or one (block>1)
      three-point formulas.
      <br>
      The RDF exported (after recording) is not smoothed</li>

    <li><b><u>V</u>ertical density profile</b><br>

      The vertical density profile is a horizontally averaged number
      density as a function of the <i>y</i>-coordinate of atoms (from
      bottom). If the system is <i>y</i>-periodic, the profile (of a
      horizontal slab) is centered at every step (i.e., it does not matter
      when the slab diffuses up and down) using formula:

      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; (L/2π)*atan2(∑ sin(yi*2π/L),∑ cos(yi*2π/L)).
      </p>

      The printed profile is placed so that the box center is zero (range
      [−L/2,L/2], the shown profile is in [0,L].  If the box dimensions
      fluctuate in the NVT ensembles, the <i>y</i>-box side is always divided
      in the same number of histogram bins (the bin width fluctuates); the
      final graph uses the averaged volume (area) for the <i>y</i>-coordinate
      as well as scaling.  The <i>y</i>-range of the shown graph is
      dynamically adjusted; overshot values are orange.  Smoothing applies as
      for RDF.  Instead of homogeneous pressure, both components Pxx and Pyy
      of the pressure tensor are shown.

    <li><b><u>D</u>roplet radial density profile</b><br>

      Droplet radial density profile shows the full angle (0–360°) averaged
      number density from the box center (if walls are present), or from the
      droplet or slab center defined as above for both x and y.

    <li><b><u>C</u>avity radial density profile</b><br>
      As above, but in periodic boundary conditions with respect to
      the cavity center,
      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; (L/2π)*(atan2(∑ sin(xi*2π/L),∑ cos(xi*2π/L))+π).
      </p>

  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i><u>T</u>inker</i></font></h3>

  <p>Technical setup affecting performance.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>FPS=<u>1</u>5</b><br>

      Set the number of frames per second to 15. The real FPS may be changed
      by slider [simulation speed]. Also, if the simulation takes a longer
      time, the real FPS is slower.

    <li><b>FPS=<u>3</u>0</b><br>

      Set the number of frames per second to 30.

    <li><b>FPS=<u>6</u>0</b><br>

      Set the number of frames per second to 60. This is the default.

    <li><b>FPS=12<u>0</u></b><br>

      Set the number of frames per second to 120.

    <li><b>Timeout <u>9</u>9% of simulation (use if shaky)</b><br>

      If the simulation takes a longer time than is given by the FPS selected,
      some timeout is still required for widget control.  Here the timeout is
      set to 99% of the simulation time.  Use this option if the response of
      widgets is slow and shaky.  See also option -T.

    <li><b>Timeout <u>5</u>0% of simulation</b><br>

      The timeout is set to 50% of the simulation time.

    <li><b>Timeout <u>2</u>0% of simulation (faster)</b><br>

      The timeout is set to 20% of the simulation time.  Use this to speed up
      the calculations, perhaps at the expense of a less precise response.

    <li><b>Timeout <u>7</u>% of simulation (fastest)</b><br>

      The timeout is set to 7% of the simulation time.  Use this to speed up
      the calculations, at the expense of a less precise response.

  <a name="Sliders"></a>
  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i>Parameters (panel of sliders)</i></font></h3>
  <p>Sliders can be moved by a mouse or (when the mouse pointer is over)
    finely by arrows.  The response of most sliders is not linear.

  <ul>
    <li><font face="helvetica">T</font> &nbsp;  Temperature.<br>

      In the Metropolis Monte Carlo method it is directly a control
      parameter of the method.  In molecular dynamics a thermostat is
      coupled to the system with a typical (correlation or coupling)
      time τ.</li>

    <li><font face="helvetica">τ</font> &nbsp; Thermostat coupling time
      (MD only).<br>

      Long time means that the system is well insulated from the thermostat
      and the system temperature approaches the predefined value T
      slowly. Short time ensues fast heat flow.</li>

    <li><font face="helvetica">d</font> &nbsp; Trial displacement radius
      (MC only).<br>

      Too long displacements change the configuration a lot, however,
      they are (at lower temperatures) rarely accepted and the
      simulation is inefficient.  Too short displacements are almost
      always accepted, however, the old and new configurations are
      almost identical.  See the acceptance ratio.  Value d=0 (bottom)
      means that the trial displacement radius is dynamically adjusted
      to reach acc.r.=1/3; in addition, long moves (new random position)
      with probability 2 % are performed.</li>

    <li><font face="helvetica">g</font> &nbsp;  Acceleration of gravity.<br>

      Negative values point downwards (as in the Earth gravitational
      field), positive upwards.  In the periodic boundary conditions the
      forces of gravity are inactive.<br>
      In addition, button [g=0] sets zero gravity.

    </li>

    <li><font face="helvetica">ρ</font> &nbsp;  Number density <font face="helvetica">ρ=N/Area</font>.<br>

      Since <font face="helvetica">N</font> is kept constant, increasing
      density actually decreased the box size L, and vice versa.  However,
      for better view, the box is displayed in the same size and the
      particle diameters are scaled instead. (Imagine you view the screen
      from such a distance that you see the particles as discs of the
      original size.)  Particle coordinates are rescaled with the box.
      <br>
      <font face="helvetica">Area</font> is defined (approximately) as
      follows:
      <ul>
        <li><font face="helvetica">Area</font> = (L−1.2)² in the box (with walls)</li>
        <li><font face="helvetica">Area</font> = L (L−1.2) in the slit</li>
        <li><font face="helvetica">Area</font> = L² in the periodic boundary conditions</li>
      </ul>

    <li><font face="helvetica">P</font> &nbsp;  Pressure.<br>
      Parameter of NPT simulations.

    <li><font face="helvetica">N</font> &nbsp;  Number of particles.<br>
      Change the number of particles.
      Note that the density is kept constant so that the box is
      rescaled, too.
      If MD is running, it will likely be switched to Monte Carlo.
      <ul>
        <li> decrease <font face="helvetica">N</font>: randomly selected particles are removed</li>
        <li> increase <font face="helvetica">N</font>: particles are inserted at random places</li>
      </ul>
      In addition, buttons [N+] and [N−] allow for adding and removing single particles.
  </ul>

  <a name="Walls + shifts"></a>
  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i>Walls + shifts</i></font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If walls are present: Clicking the respective top/bottom/left/right
      buttons will toggle repulsive (red) and attractive (green) walls.
      Button [invert] swaps repulsive ↔ attractive walls. </li>
    <li>For periodic boundary conditions: Clicking the respective shift
    left/right/up/down buttons will move the configuration.  The opposite
    moves are not the same to allow for a finer move.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="Expert"></a>
  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i>Expert</i></font></h3>
  Some more advanced functions.
  <ul>
    <li><b>record</b><br>

      Turning the [▯&nbsp;record] button on will start recording the measured
      values (of energies, pressure, etc.), including the convergence and density profiles if selected in the [include] pull-down menu. <br>

      If the [▯&nbsp;record] button is turned off, averages of the measured
      quantities are displayed (with error estimates). You may choose from:
      <ul>
        <li><font face="helvetica">clear (data lost)</font> – measured data
          are cleared, recording is turned off.</li>
        <li><font face="helvetica">save (...) and clear</font> (also Enter) –
          write the shown data and more info to a file (default name
          = <font face="helvetica">simolant.txt</font>, can be changed from
          the menu File → Protocol name...).  The file is overwritten if
          exists, however, any further invocation
          of <font face="helvetica">save and clear</font> within one session
          of SIMOLANT will append the results to the same file (unless the
          file is changed).  </li>

        <li><font face="helvetica">continue</font> (also Esc) – no
          action (continue with recording).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that averaged data (see the block slider) are recorded and
      that correlations between data are ignored in calculating the standard
      errors.</p></li>

    <li><b>CSV</b><br>
      The protocol will also be printed to a CSV file (1 line per
      [▯&nbsp;record]); note that dt and d share the same column.<br>  Both
      the <font face="helvetica">simolant.txt</font>
      and <font face="helvetica">simolant.csv</font> contain the same
      informatiom, but <font face="helvetica">simolant.txt</font> is verbose
      (human-readable) and <font face="helvetica">simolant.csv</font> contains
      just columns with a header.

    <li><b>comma</b><br>

      If selected, the recorded file will contain decimal commas, not
      dots. The same applies to the CSV file(s), where also the separator is
      changed to ';'.  The cmd: field input accepts both comma and period.
      The on-screen output uses periods only.</li>

    <li><b>include:</b><br>

      The following verbose information is generated:
      <ul>
        <li> <b><u>N</u>othing</b> – No additional information; i.e., only statistics of thermodynamic quantities is recorded.</li>
        <li> <b><u>C</u>onvergence profile</b> – Convergence profile = time series of quantites; i.e., a line of selected block-averaged thermodynamic quantities is printed for every block.</li>
        <li> <b><u>D</u>ensity profile</b> – The active density/distribution function including the cumulative function is printed when recording is stopped. The density/distribution function is selected from menu Show.</li>
        <li> <b><u>B</u>oth</b> – Both convergence profile and the selected density/distribution function.</li>
      </ul>
      If CSV is highlighted, the respective numbered CSV files are printed.
      If CSV is deselected, the same information is printed
      to the output file (<font face="helvetica">simolant.txt</font> or as set
      in the File menu) with columns separated by Tabs.

    <li><b>cmd:</b><br>
      Allows for entering data in the form of numbers instead of sliders as
      well as queries.
      The format to assign a NUMBER to a VARIABLE is:<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="helvetica">VARIABLE=NUMBER</font><br>
      To print the value of VARIABLE:<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="helvetica">VARIABLE</font><br>
      Type Enter after entering the data.
      For instance:<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="helvetica">rho=0.01</font><br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="helvetica">ρ</font><br>
      The values can be outside the respective slider range; the slider
      will then show a minimum or maximum.  A check is still made whether
      the variable entered is within some reasonable range, but not
      so strictly; the simulation may thus crash in some cases.
      Both decimal comma and dot are accepted (irrespective of the comma
      toggle); note that this does not apply for option -P.

        <li> <b><u>N</u>eighbors</b> – Molecules are drawn in colors according
          to the number of neighbors (molecules lying closer than 1.55:
          a tick will appear in the RDF graph to mark this distance).
          New colors are calculated every step (unless you select Keep).</li>
        <li> <b><u>R</u>andom</b> – Colorize atoms randomly (and keep these colors).</li>
        <li> <b><u>A</u>rt</b> – Cycle colors on the RGB wheel, best with draw
          mode Lines. The speed of change can be controlled by variable trace
          from cmd:</li>
        <li> <b><u>K</u>eep</b> – Previously selected colors are kept.</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li><b>reset</b><br> Restore the default behavior (movie of black
      molecules).  The convergence profiles are reset, too (if shown).</li>
    <li><b>set MC moves</b><br> In MC simulations: The trial move size (and in
      NPT also dV) is adjusted automatically to reach the acceptance ratio of
      0.3.  Should be turned off before a productive run.</li>
    <li><b>run</b><br>
      Stop the simulation temporarily. All other functions
      (parameter change etc.) work as usual and become active as soon
      as the simulation is resumed.  Useful to change parameters if the
      current setup keeps launching errors.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="Speed"></a>
  <h3><font color="navy" face="sans"><i>Simulation speed and measurement blocking</i></font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>simulation speed</b><br> This slider controls the speed of the
      simulation/movie and the stride of calculations (of quantities).  The
      fourth line in the right panel contains the value of stride and the
      requested time between frames in ms.
      <ul>
        <li> Leftmost: very slow, every frame is shown with a low FPS (frames per second).</li>
        <li> Left: every frame is shown with the selected FPS (see menu Tinker).</li>
        <li> Center: every 3rd configuration is shown with the selected FPS. This is the default.</li>
        <li> Right: every tenth configuration is shown with the selected FPS.</li>
        <li> Rightmost: every tenth configuration is shown as fast as possible
          (no delays added). In addition, if circle=2 (cicles composed of
          lines) is selected, it is ignored for L&gt;10 and fl_pie() is used
          (as with circle=0). This is faster, but some text may be
          overdrawn.</li>
      </ul>
      Note that for many particles, the calculation and showing may be slower
      than the selected FPS.
    </li>
    <li><b>measurement block</b><br> Quantities of interest (kinetic
      temperature, pressure, RDF) are averaged over certain number of
      simulation steps (sweeps in MC) and then displayed at once.  The block
      length is in range [1,100], the default is 10.  The selected stride (see
      slide simulation speed) still applied; therefore, stride*block=10*100
      means that 1000 MD steps are performed to get one block summary
      data.</li>

  <a name="Bugs"></a>
  <h2><font color="NAVY" face="SANS">Known bugs and caveats</font></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>There are still timing, thread-priority, and/or efficiency problems.
      The original dumb X11-only version was faster.</li>
    <li>Both / and \ treated as directory separator (on all platforms).</li>
    <li>Inconsistent command line option format.</li>
    <li>Under hard conditions (fast changes of N, density), an
      out-of-box particle may pass unnoticed and cause various
      errors.</li>
